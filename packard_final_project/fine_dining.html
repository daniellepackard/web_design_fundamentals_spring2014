	<h2>Fine Dining: Le Cuisine</h2>
	<p>At our signature restaurant Le Cuisine, the creative menus accentuate the native flavors of the region with a strong influence on seasonality, local garden-to-table agriculture and an affinity for wine pairings.<p>
	<p>Embracing thoughtful, educated service, our highly trained staff graciously offers to customize your wine pairing to complement cuisine selections. In-Room Dining menus, private dining and catered affairs are created under the professional direction of our culinary team for an authentic culinary adventure.</p>
	<p>In our Living Room adjacent to Le Cuisine's Bar, relax with a glass of wine from our extensive wine list.</p>
	<p>On Friday and Saturday, live jazz entertainment sets the tone for the night with a designer cocktail or perhaps end the evening with a night cap. A bar menu is also available for your pleasure.</p>
	<p>In-Room Dining from Le Cuisine's kitchen is available 24 hours to be enjoyed in the privacy of your accommodations. Items can be selected from the dining room or bar menu along with cocktails and wines by the glass or bottle.</p>
	<p>Our comprehensive wine collection has representation from California and Washington, as well as wine regions from around the globe: France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Hungary, New Zealand, South Africa, Austria, Spain and Lebanon.</p>
	<p>Le Cuisine's impressive cellar encompasses more than 800 labels and ever-changing extensive wines by the glass menu. Wine flight sampling has become a popular way to become educated about local wines and how they compare to other country's selections. Our curated cellar selections will please the most seasoned palate.</p>
	<p>Consistently recognized as one of the best restaurants in the country, we invite you to join us for a meal.</p>
