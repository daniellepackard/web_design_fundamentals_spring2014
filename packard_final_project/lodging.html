	<h1>Guest Suites</h1>
	<p>Our 20 spacious Guest Suites are quietly luxurious and thoughtfully appointed. All suites have king beds. Oversized open-air windows and doorways let sunlight and fresh air in and provide vistas of the rainforest and countryside. All rooms feature "Haiku Big Ass" ceiling fans, wet bar, original artwork and custom crafted furnishings, while a complimentary welcome snack basket, luxurious robes and slippers make you feel at home. Settle in and let the relaxing begin...</p>

	<p>Every suite has a front row seat to the sounds (and sometimes views) of the rainforest's resident gorilla and primate colonies, exotic birds, several varieties of frogs and many other delightful rainforest residents, as well as lulling sounds of rain at times.</p>
